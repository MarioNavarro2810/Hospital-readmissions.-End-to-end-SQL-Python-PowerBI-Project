### Objective
This project aims to **predict hospital readmission risk** by building an **end-to-end data pipeline** that connects **SQL data extraction**, **Python preprocessing and modeling**, and **Power BI visualization**.  
The final product supports **clinical decision-making**, helping hospitals **reduce readmissions** and **optimize resource allocation**.


### Project Overview  
**Hospital readmissions** are among the most relevant operational and clinical issues in healthcare.  
They often stem from preventable causes such as premature discharges, inadequate post-discharge follow-up, or unaddressed comorbidities.  
By leveraging data analytics, hospitals can identify **which patients are most at risk of being readmitted** and implement targeted interventions, such as home monitoring programs or optimized discharge planning.

From a management perspective, reducing avoidable readmissions translates into:
- Lower hospitalization costs and optimized bed occupancy.  
- Improved patient outcomes and satisfaction.  
- Data-backed resource allocation and strategic planning.

This project proposes a complete **end-to-end analytical solution** designed to understand, predict, and mitigate hospital readmissions through the use of data analytics, statistical modeling, and business intelligence.

The workflow integrates all stages of the data lifecycle with the ultimate goal of **supporting clinical decision-making and resource optimization**.


**Our analytical workflow:**

1. **SQL ‚Äì Data Extraction and Integration**

All data operations start within the hospital database (`dm_cardiologia`).  
Using advanced **SQL analytical queries**, the dataset is explored and key performance indicators are computed to understand patient behavior and hospitalization dynamics.

Main SQL tasks include:
- **Descriptive metrics** such as *total number of patients and admissions*
- **Readmission analytics** such as *average admissions and unique patients per month*


2. **Python ‚Äì Preprocessing and Risk Modeling**  
   - Data imported from SQL and analyzed using `pandas` and `numpy`.  
   - Statistical hypothesis testing to identify significant risk factors:  
     - **Chi-square test (œá¬≤)** for associations between categorical variables (e.g., diagnosis, treatment type, readmission).  
     - **t-Student test** for mean comparison across patient groups (e.g., age, length of stay).  
   - Development of a **custom scoring function (`calcular_scoring`)** assigning weighted points to each variable based on its relationship with readmission risk.  
  
3. **Power BI ‚Äì Visualization and Insights**

   - The final dataset from SQL was **imported** into Power BI for data visualization and reporting.

   - **Basic transformations** were applied in Power Query (mainly regional and formatting adjustments).

   - **Interactive dashboards** were designed to display key insights on admissions, readmissions, and risk segmentation.

   - **Visual interactions** were refined for a clear analytical flow
  
   - **Final publication** to online PowerBI Service
